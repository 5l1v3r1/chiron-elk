ELK tends to be flaky at times, so we decided to provide you with a basic troubleshooting guide
if you are "cable cutter" and you use internet for everything you may get indeces in excess of 5 GB per day
This is big data at home. Chiron has features for auto maintenance and deletion of indeces and logs. However
depending on the network traffic ELK may become overwhelmed. Below a basic troubleshooting guide. 

Basic ELK troubleshooting guide

ISSUE: Kibana is not available

1. Check if Kibana service is running: systemctl status kibana
2. Check if port 5601 is reachable

Default Kibana logs are in syslog file /var/log/syslog

ISSUE: Kibana is available, but reports "Red" status for Elasticsearch backend

1. Check that Elasticsearch service is running: systemctl status elasticsearch.service
NOTE: Elasticsearch service needs up to 3 minutes to start on boot

2. Check if Elasticsearch is healthy:
curl localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
{
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "status" : "yellow",
      "timed_out" : false,
      "number_of_nodes" : 1,
      "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
      "active_primary_shards" : 46,
      "active_shards" : 46,
      "relocating_shards" : 0,
      "initializing_shards" : 0,
      "unassigned_shards" : 46,
      "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
      "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
      "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
      "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
      "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 50.0
    }
3. Check disk space available for Elasticsearch:
curl -sS -XGET "localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?h=d*&v"
    disk.total disk.used disk.avail disk.used_percent
        18.1gb     4.3gb     13.7gb             23.92
Default Elasticsearch logs location: /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log

ISSUE: Kibana is OK, but there are no messages in Discovery or Dashboards

1. Check the time period on the top right corner
2. Make sure that Logstash is running: systemctl status logstash.service
NOTE: Logstash needs up to 3 min to start and it may take up to 10 sec for new messages to be searchable.

Logstash default logs location: /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log (edited)
